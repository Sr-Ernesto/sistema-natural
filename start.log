 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /home/osbrai/.openclaw/workspace/package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `outputFileTracingRoot` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output#caveats for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles: 
   * /home/osbrai/.openclaw/workspace/projects/sistema-natural-nextjs/package-lock.json

 ⚠ "next start" does not work with "output: standalone" configuration. Use "node .next/standalone/server.js" instead.
